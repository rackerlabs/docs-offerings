API reference
=============

Learn about the following |api-service| resources and operations, and
see request and response examples. You can use the |api-service| operations
to interact directly with the service.

.. note::

     You can also perform operations by using the `Cloud Control Panel <https://mycloud.rackspace.com/>`_.

.. COMMENT: Group your api methods into logical categories, usually by
   the resource in the method URL.  Use the resource-one-methods.rst file as
   a model and create one file for each category or resource, naming it
   appropriately (for example, images-operations.rst). Add your category files
   here.  Update the category files with the methods, and add the methods to
   the method folder.
